Title: Machine Learning for Student Performance Prediction (Linear Regression)

Description:

This repository implements a machine learning model using linear regression to predict student performance (final grade, G3) based on features like previous grades (G1, G2), study time, failures, and absences.
The given Features are selected on the basis of most influence on the result and prediction. Built with Python, it leverages robust libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing values (optional) using a mean imputer (adjustable strategy).
Splits data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Linear Regression Model:
Trains a linear regression model to learn the relationship between features and final grade.

Calculates the R-squared score to assess model performance.
Provides coefficients and intercept for model interpretability.

Evaluation and Visualization:
Generates predictions on the test set.
Creates a scatter plot to visualize predicted vs. actual final grades.
Optionally includes a trendline for visual reference.
